First query: creating a table for your data

CREATE TABLE public.city_state (
	state VARCHAR
	, city VARCHAR
	
);


Second query: creating a stored procedure to pull data from S3
Note: for credentials, you can use an AWS IAM role or access keys

CREATE PROCEDURE s3_csv_import()
AS $$
	BEGIN
	copy city_state from 's3://<YOUR-BUCKET-NAME-HERE>/<FILENAME>.csv'
	credentials 'YOUR-CREDENTIALS-HERE'
	IGNOREHEADER 1
	csv;
	END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql
;

Third query: calling your stored procedure

CALL s3_csv_import();
